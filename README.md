## About:
This is a collaborative project, completed as an assignment for a Year 1 Module at the University of Exeter, using back-end development. It was completed using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

## Project Description:
The University of Knowledge (UoK) is extremely pleased with the partnership with their students in the development of their own systems. The experience has been shown to be positive to all. Now, the UoK is planning to create its own social media platform. In order to balance the workload among the students, the UoK divided the system development in two groups, front-end and back-end. This assignment is based around the development of a back-end Java package for the UoK. It has already determined the functionality required of the system, and has provided an interface to be used between the back-end you develop, and the front-end the other group is developing. UoK staff will be able to simply compile in the jar file of the package developed, with the rest of their system, to result in a fully functioning solution.

## Other:
This pair project was built entirely using Object-Oriented Programming in Java
